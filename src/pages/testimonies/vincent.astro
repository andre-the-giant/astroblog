<p>I've had the chance to work with Andre and can't recommend him enough. If you need a strong frontend team lead or engineering manager, he's the one. </p>
<p>He's got the technical package - accessibility, scaling, web performance, modularity, UX. But what makes Andre special is how amazing he is with people. </p>
<p>He makes the workplace better: bringing energy, support, and joy to the team. Anyone would be lucky to work with him. I certainly was.</p>
