I recently had one of the best interviews of my career. The case study went smoothly, the conversation was genuine, and I felt completely in my element. I gave everything I had, and I left the meeting energized and proud. It felt right.  

A few weeks later, the email came. The feedback was kind, but the answer was the disappointing one. The reason? **They needed someone with more experience managing stakeholders at a global scale.**  

Everything else was positive : my leadership style, my approach to people, my technical insight. But that one missing piece was enough to close the door.  

## The best kind of interview process

To be fair, the company did an excellent job designing the interview process.   They made sure every candidate had the chance to do their best work. There were no trick questions or surprise whiteboard challenges. They offered clear guidance, shared interview tips ahead of time, and gave enough time to prepare for the case study.  

That's rare!
I've seen so much worst, like companies throw candidates into high-pressure architecture questions with no context, limited time, and a "sink or swim" attitude.  
This one didn't. It was respectful, transparent, and focused on real skills.  

Which made the rejection even more bittersweet, because the process itself showed care, empathy, and a genuine interest in finding the right fit.


## The gap between what's written and what's meant

What made the feedback hard to swallow wasn't just the rejection. It was opening the job description again and realizing there was **no mention of global stakeholder management** anywhere. They recently re-posted the job, and no change was made. Instead, the company proudly said:  
> "We take your personal and professional development goals seriously, and we support them through training, coaching, and mindfulness, as well as with an open feedback culture."

If you claim to value personal development, then live by it! Don't turn around and say no to a candidate just because they are missing one skill that could easily be developed with mentorship and exposure. We need to stop the corporate talk about "growth culture" while only hiring people who already check every box. If you only hire those who already have the experience, you're not developing anyone, you're just recycling talent.

## What personal development actually looks like

Real development is not sending people to a leadership course once a year. It's about giving them **opportunities to stretch, learn, and grow on the job**.  

The irony is that many candidates, myself included, are extremely aware of their growth gaps. We can clearly say, **"Here's what I need to improve, and here's how I plan to work on it."** That's exactly the kind of mindset companies claim to want : self-awareness, curiosity, and accountability.  

So why not bet on that?  If someone can identify what they need to learn and already has a plan to get there, that's not a weakness. That's potential.


## The courage to invest in people

Hiring someone who still has room to grow takes courage. It's easier to pick a "safer" candidate with a familiar background, even if it means missing out on diversity of thought and experience.  

As an Engineering Manager, this is something I care deeply about when I recruit developers. I look for potential first. I list the gaps I see, and I talk about them openly during the interview. I want to know if the candidate is aware of those gaps and how they plan to fill them in. That discussion tells me much more about their growth mindset than any perfect résumé ever could.  

Strong organizations are built by people who evolve inside them, not just those who walk in fully formed. Leaders who are willing to learn bring humility and adaptability, two traits that are essential in fast-changing environments.  

When companies stop taking those chances, they lose the opportunity to shape the next generation of leaders who will drive their culture forward.

## The real meaning of development culture

Culture is not what you write on a career page. It's what you do when faced with a choice between the perfect résumé and the promising one.  If you truly believe in development, prove it! 
Hire people with potential. 
Coach them. 
Give them feedback and time.  
Let them surprise you.  

Because every "not quite ready" candidate who's hungry to grow can become one of your strongest leaders if you give them the chance.



**I didn't get that job, and yes, it was disappointing. But I still walked away with clarity. I know what I bring to the table, and I know exactly where I want to grow next.**

**Companies love to talk about personal development. It's time they start practicing it!**
