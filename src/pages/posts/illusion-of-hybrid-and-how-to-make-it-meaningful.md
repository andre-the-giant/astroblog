Last month, I had an interview for a so-called "hybrid" role, three mandatory days at the office.  
The HR representative explained that the team was distributed, so most of my meetings would still happen over Zoom.  
"It might feel strange to go to the office and spend your day in calls," she said, "but at least you'll be here, creating relationships with people around."  

I asked what the benefits were, or if there was any plan to make those office days meaningful.  
No clear answer. No guidelines. No structure.  
Just presence for the sake of presence.

That conversation stayed with me because it captures what hybrid has become in many companies: an illusion of flexibility that does not serve anyone.

## When hybrid becomes theater

Across the industry, hybrid has turned into a checkbox with no purpose behind it.  
People commute, spend hours in traffic, and join the same online meetings they could have done from home.  
Leaders hope this will restore collaboration and culture, but instead it reveals how fragile both have become.

The problem is not hybrid itself. It is that most organizations never took the time to design it properly.  

## Understanding the leadership challenge

As someone who manages engineers, I understand the pressure on leadership.  
Rebuilding connection, culture, and mentorship is difficult when teams are spread across cities or countries.  
There are real constraints such as office leases, fairness across teams, accountability, and the genuine desire to see people collaborate again.  

But these constraints are not excuses for poor design. They are the boundaries we need to work within.  
As Will Larson writes in *An Elegant Puzzle*, systems need intention.  Hybrid is not a perk or a rule. It is a system, and systems fail when their purpose is unclear.

## The missing design principle: purpose

Most companies did not design their hybrid model. They simply scheduled it.  
There is rarely a shared understanding of what in-person time is meant to achieve.  
Is it for brainstorming, whiteboarding, celebrating wins, starting new projects, or building relationships?  

When everything is treated the same, whether it is a Zoom call or a strategy session, the result is fatigue and disengagement. People are not resisting the office. They are resisting wasting time.

## From policy to system: the three pillars of meaningful hybrid

If we want hybrid to work, it needs structure.  
In my experience, effective hybrid teams are built on three simple pillars.

1. **Purposeful presence**  
Every in-office day should have a clear reason to exist. Use it for strategy workshops, planning sessions, or team celebrations, not random attendance.  
2. **Asynchronous discipline**  
Remote days should not be treated as "out of sight, out of mind." They are best used for deep work, clear documentation, and thoughtful communication.  
3. **Rituals that connect**  
Teams need consistent rhythms that make both modes human, from short virtual coffee chats to quarterly in-person offsites that strengthen relationships beyond the screen.  

These are not grand policies. They are habits that make hybrid feel intentional instead of arbitrary.

## Balancing both sides of the ROI

Hybrid should not only make employees happier. It should also help organizations build stronger teams. When designed well, hybrid supports mentorship, innovation, and culture by making time together meaningful. It also strengthens remote collaboration by clarifying what should be done asynchronously.  

It is not about office snacks or ping pong tables. It is about designing environments that help people think, build, and connect.  

## Leadership through trust, not visibility

If presence is measured only by who shows up in person, we have missed the point.  
Real presence means being engaged, aligned, and accountable, wherever you are.  
Strong leadership is not about counting chairs filled. It is about designing systems where collaboration happens naturally. That takes discipline and clarity, but it is the kind of leadership our teams deserve.

## Back to purpose

Hybrid could have been our generationâ€™s biggest management experiment. It could have been an opportunity to redesign work around trust, clarity, and purpose.  

We still have that opportunity, but only if we stop treating the office as a checkbox and start using it as a tool for connection and meaning.  

**As leaders, we owe our teams more than empty policies.  
We owe them environments where every hour, and every relationship, truly matters.**
