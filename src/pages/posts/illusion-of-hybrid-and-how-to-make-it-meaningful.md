Last month, I had an interview for a so-called "hybrid" role, three mandatory days at the office. The HR rep calmly explained that the team was distributed, so most of my meetings would still happen over Zoom.  
"It might feel strange to go to the office and spend your day in calls," she said, "but at least you'll be here, creating relationships with people around."  

I asked what the benefits were, or if there was any plan to make those office days meaningful. No clear answer. No guidelines. No structure. Just presence for the sake of presence.

## When hybrid becomes theater

That conversation stayed with me because it captures the illusion so many companies live in.  
They call it hybrid, but in practice, it's a half-hearted return to the office.  
Employees spend energy, time and money commuting, only to sit in the same online meetings they could have joined from home.  

The problem isn't hybrid itself. It's that most companies didn't take the time to design it.  

## What leaders are trying to fix

To be fair, I understand why leaders want people back. They worry about losing connection, culture, and spontaneous collaboration. They miss the energy of hallway chats and the small moments that build trust.  

Those concerns are valid. But forcing everyone back without a plan doesn't rebuild culture; it just exposes how fragile it was in the first place.  

## The missing design principle: purpose

Most companies didn't design their hybrid model, they just scheduled it. There's no shared understanding of what in-person time is for. Is it for whiteboarding Brainstorming? Celebrating wins? Starting new projects? Building relationships?  

When everything is treated the same (Zoom calls, strategy sessions, and quick syncs) the result is confusion and fatigue. People commute for work that could have been done better remotely.  

As Will Larson reminds us in *An Elegant Puzzle*, good systems are intentional.  
Hybrid isn't a perk or a rule, it's a system. And systems need structure to work.  

## How to make time together count

Hybrid can be meaningful if it's designed with intention.  
That means defining when being together creates more value than being apart.  
Some examples:  
- **Whiteboarding a complex problem** where body language and fast iteration help.  
- **Kicking off a new project** so people connect beyond avatars and usernames.  
- **Celebrating milestones** as humans, not screens.  
- Using office time for **collaboration**, not for catching up on Slack.  

When in-person days have a purpose, they stop feeling like an obligation. They become a tool for creativity, energy, and connection.

## Leadership through trust, not visibility

If presence is only measured by who shows up in person, we've missed the point.  
Real presence is about being engaged, connected, and aligned. Wherever you are.  
Strong leadership isn't about counting chairs filled, it's about creating clarity and trust so teams can perform anywhere.  

That's harder work than setting a schedule, but it's the work that matters.  

## Back to purpose

Hybrid could have been our generation's biggest management experiment, a chance to redesign work around trust, clarity, and purpose.  

We still have that chance, but only if we stop treating the office as a checkbox and start designing it as a tool for connection and meaning.  

As leaders, we owe our teams more than empty policies. We owe them environments where every hour, and every relationship, actually matters.
