Dealing with code is just one aspect of being an engineering manager. You make important technical decisions, lead teams, develop strategies, and interact with stakeholders. However, the question of how crucial coding experience is for an engineering manager is still up for debate. Does managing developers effectively need coding knowledge?

Understanding the task, mindset, and difficulties faced by developers greatly improves your leadership, even if you don't have to write production code every day. I firmly think that being able to code makes you a more successful EM. Let me tell you why.

## Understanding the developer experience

Managing developers isn't just about assigning tasks or tracking velocity. You're managing people who need creativity, inspiration, and space to innovate. Coding experience helps you deeply understand this reality.

It helps you understand productivity obstacles like frequent interruptions, context switching, or cognitive overload. Having faced these challenges yourself makes you better at addressing them proactively and effectively.

I experienced this firsthand while reviewing code. When I noticed a senior developer's reviews were superficial and low-quality, it signaled deeper concerns. Understanding code allowed me to quickly spot signs of disengagement or possible burnout, enabling meaningful conversations and proactive solutions.

## Better technical and strategic decisions

Being hands-on doesn't always mean writing production code. It means maintaining enough technical involvement, reviewing code, pairing occasionally, or actively engaging in technical discussionsâ€”to earn credibility and make informed decisions.

When you understand code, your team's respect naturally follows. You set realistic timelines, balance technical trade-offs, and align closely with business objectives. Technical fluency helps you avoid overly ambitious or impractical projects and advocate for quality and sustainability.

## Diversity of thought and leadership collaboration

While technical experience is important, leadership benefits from diverse perspectives. Non-technical leaders often contribute valuable insights around collaboration, communication, organizational culture, or strategic alignment. Balancing technical and non-technical leadership can create a healthier, more effective management team.

A strong partnership between Engineering Managers, Tech Leads, and Senior Engineers is especially important. EMs who might lack deep coding expertise can still lead effectively through trust and close collaboration with experienced technical partners. This teamwork ensures decisions are both technically sound and strategically aligned.

## Coaching, culture, and continuous learning

A technical background greatly enhances your credibility, particularly when mentoring junior developers. Sharing practical coding tips or debugging strategies helps you support your team meaningfully and fosters genuine trust.

Technical fluency also helps you nurture a healthy engineering culture. Advocating for clean code, thorough testing, proper documentation, and continuous learning becomes second nature. You're better at identifying early signs of technical issues or burnout, enabling proactive solutions.

If you're an EM without coding experience, it's never too late! Collaborate closely with trusted senior developers, pair occasionally on simple tasks, or invest time learning basic coding principles. Demonstrating willingness to learn and understand earns your team's respect and trust.


Can you manage developers without having coded yourself? Probably. But will you be as effective as someone who knows firsthand the struggles, frustrations, and joys of coding? I don't think so.


**Coding experience provides substantial advantages: deeper empathy, informed decision-making, better mentorship, and a healthier team culture. You don't have to code daily, but having a solid technical understanding ensures you truly lead your team rather than merely managing them.**
