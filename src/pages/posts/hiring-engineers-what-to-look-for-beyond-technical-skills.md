Hiring great engineers is about more than just technical ability. Writing clean code, understanding system architecture, and solving technical problems are essential, but they are not the only things that make an engineer a valuable team member.

A great engineer brings more than just technical knowledge. They communicate well, take ownership of their work, collaborate effectively, and continuously learn. They also need to fit into the broader team, which means balancing skill levels, experience, and diversity. When hiring, I am not just looking for the best individual candidate. I am building a strong team, one that works well together and brings different perspectives.

## Why technical skills alone are not enough

I have seen engineers with outstanding technical ability struggle in real-world teams because they lacked key non-technical skills. Some were brilliant but could not communicate their ideas clearly. Others resisted feedback or refused to adjust when faced with changing requirements.

One of the biggest issues with hiring based only on technical tests is that it does not tell you how a person will work within a team. An engineer might ace a coding challenge but struggle to collaborate, fail to document their work, or refuse to compromise when discussing technical trade-offs.

On the other hand, I have hired engineers who were not the strongest in coding exercises but thrived because they knew how to solve problems, take initiative, and work effectively with others. Technical skills can be improved over time, but a poor attitude or inability to work with a team is much harder to fix.

## Key traits I look for beyond technical skills

When hiring, I focus on these traits as much as technical expertise:

- **Communication:** An engineer needs to explain their ideas clearly, whether in code reviews, documentation, or discussions with non-technical stakeholders. They should be able to express why they made certain decisions and listen to feedback.
- **Ownership:** The best engineers do not just complete tasks. They take responsibility for the success of the feature, system, or product they are working on. They care about quality, performance, and how their work impacts the team and users.
- **Problem-solving ability:** Writing code is just one part of being an engineer. The real challenge is understanding problems, evaluating different solutions, and making smart trade-offs.
- **Adaptability:** The tech industry evolves constantly. Engineers who cannot adjust to new technologies, changing priorities, or evolving best practices will eventually slow the team down.
- **Curiosity and learning mindset:** I prefer hiring engineers who are excited to learn rather than those who only rely on what they already know. Someone who enjoys experimenting with new tools, improving their skills, and understanding the bigger picture will bring long-term value to the team.
- **How they handle feedback:** Engineering is full of discussions and disagreements, from code reviews to architectural decisions. The best engineers listen to feedback, adjust when necessary, and approach discussions with the goal of improving rather than proving themselves right.

## Building a balanced and diverse team

Hiring is not just about the individual, it's about the team. When building a team, I consider balance in skill levels, perspectives, and experiences.

A well-structured team should have a mix of junior, intermediate, and senior engineers. Senior engineers bring experience and mentorship, while junior engineers bring fresh perspectives and new energy. Having a mix ensures long-term growth rather than a team that is too dependent on a few individuals.

Diversity also plays a key role. I actively try to build teams that are balanced in gender, inclusive of underrepresented groups, and open to neurodivergent individuals or those with disabilities. A diverse team is not just about fairness, it leads to better discussions, broader problem-solving approaches, and a more welcoming team culture.

## Being aware of bias in hiring

Every hiring decision is influenced by bias, whether we realize it or not. It is easy to prefer candidates who think like us, communicate in ways we find familiar, or fit our idea of what a "good engineer" looks like. But real inclusivity means questioning those instincts and ensuring that we are giving the same opportunity to all candidates.

I have personally faced this when I was about to reject a candidate for a front-end engineering role. I was looking for someone with deep knowledge of CSS and SCSS. During the interview, the candidate seemed uncomfortable, took long pauses before answering, avoided eye contact, and responded in a very direct way that could have been interpreted as arrogance. My first instinct was that they would not fit well in the team.

But their portfolio was outstanding, showcasing a deep understanding of accessibility, responsiveness, and UI performance. Their CodePen projects were some of the most impressive I had seen, showing both creativity and expertise. In the end, I decided to hire them (wink wink to you, D!)

After working together, I learned that they were autistic and that interviews were a nightmare for them. Their structured way of answering questions was not arrogance, but simply how they processed information. This experience taught me a valuable lesson: first impressions in interviews are not always accurate, and great engineers do not always present themselves in the way we expect.

This is why I actively challenge my own biases. A strong team is built by focusing on skills, mindset, and potential, not just interview performance.

## How I evaluate these traits in interviews

Technical interviews should not just be about solving algorithm problems. I design my interviews to assess how a candidate thinks, communicates, and adapts.

I do this by focusing on:

- **How they explain their technical choices.** A great engineer does not just write code but understands and justifies their approach.
- **How they react to feedback.** If I suggest an alternative solution, do they engage in a discussion or shut down?
- **How they approach a problem they do not know the answer to.** No one knows everything. I want to see how they break down an unfamiliar problem rather than just whether they get the "right" answer.
- **Their past experiences with learning something new.** I often ask about a time they had to quickly adapt to a new technology or situation. This gives insight into their ability to grow rather than just what they already know.

## What engineering managers can do to hire beyond technical skills

Engineering managers play a crucial role in shaping the hiring process and ensuring that teams are built for long-term success, not just immediate technical needs. One of the most impactful things a manager can do is design an interview process that evaluates more than just coding ability. This means structuring interviews to assess communication, ownership, problem-solving, and adaptability.

A good manager should also actively push for diversity in hiring. It is easy to default to hiring candidates who feel familiar, but great teams come from a mix of perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences. This means reviewing job descriptions for unintentional bias, ensuring diverse candidate pools, and making sure hiring decisions are based on skill and potential rather than assumptions or personal comfort.

Another key responsibility is helping the team understand why these factors matter. Senior engineers often have a strong voice in hiring, and they may unconsciously prioritize technical skills over everything else. An engineering manager should guide these conversations, reminding the team that hiring is about building a well-rounded, collaborative group, not just adding technical depth.

## Hiring shapes the future of a team

**Every hire impacts team culture, collaboration, and long-term success. The challenge is not just finding technically strong engineers but ensuring they fit into a balanced and inclusive team. A managerâ€™s role is to see beyond technical skills, challenge biases, and build a team that thrives together.**
