## When leadership becomes surveillance

I once worked in a company where upper management didn’t trust the engineering team at all. That kind of distrust seeps into everything, and the worst version of it showed up in the form of a spreadsheet. Each developer had to report, daily, the percentage of completion of every single task they were working on to their manager. Managers would follow up and push people to get an update, even if the work hadn’t changed much since the last check-in. It was exhausting and demoralizing.

The message was clear: we don’t trust you to do your job unless we’re tracking you like a delivery package. No one liked it. Developers stopped caring about the quality of what they shipped and focused on filling in numbers that would keep them from being questioned. Tasks became superficial. Estimates were padded or faked. Conversations about what really mattered stopped happening altogether.

That’s micromanagement in action. It’s not guidance, it’s control, and it doesn’t lead to better delivery. It leads to apathy.

## Why it doesn’t even work

Micromanagement is often driven by fear. Executives fear being blindsided, missing deadlines, or being held accountable when something slips. They think control will give them visibility, and visibility will give them safety. But it doesn’t work like that. More updates don’t mean more insight. More oversight doesn’t mean better outcomes. It just creates a culture where teams optimize for the wrong thing: not being blamed.

You lose trust, you lose initiative, people stop making decisions, they stop thinking critically. They stop caring about the product, and instead care about avoiding heat. Engineers stop asking, "What’s the best way to solve this?" and start asking, "What will get approved the fastest?"

If the end result is that nobody’s taking risks, and everybody’s waiting for permission, then what exactly is being managed? It’s not progress. It’s compliance. And that’s not what builds good software.

## What engineering managers should do instead

Start by **giving clarity**. People can’t be autonomous if they don’t know where they’re going. Talk about outcomes, not just deliverables. **Define priorities**. Make sure the team knows why the work matters, and how success will be measured. If everyone’s clear on what good looks like, you don’t need to watch every step.

Then **give trust**. Don’t assume silence means someone’s off-track. Check in, offer help, unblock where needed, but don’t stand over their shoulder. Trust is the baseline, not the reward.

**Shift your attention to results**. Don’t obsess over time spent. Ask whether the thing that needed to happen is actually happening. You’ll get much better information by asking engineers what’s unclear or what’s slowing them down than by asking how many hours they worked on it.

And most importantly, protect the team from the very instinct to micromanage. **Don’t pass pressure down**. Don’t ask for metrics you wouldn’t want to fill out yourself. When execs push for more control, push back with more context. Show the bigger picture, and show your trust in the team’s ability to get there.

Cultivating ownership and commitment doesn’t happen through control. It happens when people feel responsible for the outcome, not just for their assigned piece. Invite engineers into planning conversations and let them challenge priorities. Give them space to shape solutions, not just implement specs. When people help decide what gets built and how, they care more about the result.

**Celebrate initiative**. When someone goes above the brief, acknowledge it. When someone flags a risk early, thank them. Small signals shape culture, so if you want your team to take ownership, reinforce the behaviors that show it.

And when things go wrong, don’t default to correction. Default to curiosity. Ask what they were trying to do. Ask what felt unclear. That’s how people learn. That’s how they feel safe enough to try again, and better.



**Micromanagement feels active. It feels like leadership. But it’s not. It’s just anxiety in spreadsheet form. And the moment you start treating people like they can’t be trusted, they’ll stop showing you what they’re really capable of.**
