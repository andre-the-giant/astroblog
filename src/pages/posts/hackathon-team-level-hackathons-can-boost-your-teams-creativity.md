Hackathons are often seen as large, company-wide events where engineers, designers, and product managers come together to build creative projects in a short period. While these can be exciting, they do not always lead to meaningful improvements for individual teams. Large-scale hackathons sometimes suffer from a lack of follow-up, with great ideas never making it past demo day.

But **hackathons do not need to be massive**. Engineering managers can run team-level hackathons that focus on solving real problems, experimenting with new technologies, and improving developer workflows. These smaller, more focused hackathons often have a bigger impact because they are aligned with the team's actual work and lead to actionable results.

## Getting buy-in from leadership and cross-functional partners

Before announcing a hackathon, an engineering manager needs to make sure key stakeholders support the idea. Running a hackathon requires setting aside dedicated time, which means getting buy-in from the director of engineering, product manager, designer, QA, and other cross-functional partners. Without their support, the hackathon risks becoming a side project that no one takes seriously.

The best way to approach leadership is by **framing the hackathon as an investment**, not a distraction. A hackathon gives engineers space to fix internal pain points, experiment with new technologies, and explore innovative solutions that might otherwise never get prioritized. Highlighting the **business value** makes it easier to justify.

## Defining the purpose of the hackathon

A hackathon can be completely open-ended, where engineers build whatever they want, or it can have a defined focus. There is no right or wrong approach, but setting **clear expectations** helps ensure the event stays productive. Some teams choose a theme to guide the hackathon. Engineers can focus on improving developer experience, automating repetitive tasks, or exploring new technologies that could benefit the team in the long run.

Regardless of the theme, the most important thing is **making sure projects do not just disappear after** the hackathon. More on that later.

## Carving time for the hackathon

The biggest challenge in running a hackathon at the team level is making sure the team actually has time to participate. A hackathon squeezed between normal sprint work will not be successful. Engineers need dedicated, uninterrupted time to focus on their projects.

Some teams schedule hackathons at the end of a sprint, using it as a break before the next cycle begins. Others block out a full day or two each quarter. The key is **treating the hackathon as real work**, not an afterthought.

## Launching the hackathon with energy!

A strong **kickoff meeting** sets the tone for the hackathon. This is where the team gets excited, understands the goals, and starts forming ideas. An engineering manager should clearly explain why the hackathon is happening, what the expectations are, and how projects will be presented at the end.

Encouraging collaboration is key. Engineers can work solo, but hackathons are more fun and productive when people team up. Some teams form groups ahead of time, while others let people pitch ideas at the kickoff and then form teams based on interest.

In a previous company I worked for, we managed to have lunch expensed, so hackathon participants could focus more on their project (and who's not motivated by free lunch?).

The hackathon itself should be **structured but flexible**. People need space to focus, but quick check-ins throughout the day help keep energy levels high. The goal is not just to build something, but to experiment, learn, and explore ideas without normal sprint constraints.

## Presenting and celebrating projects

At the end of the hackathon, teams present their work. This is where a strong demo culture matters. Engineers should not just show what they built, but explain **why it is useful, how it was built, and what the next steps could be**. A demo should not feel like a final product showcase: it should be a way to share knowledge and get feedback.

**Recognition is important**. Whether it is a small prize, a fun award category, or just public acknowledgment of great work, making sure engineers feel appreciated for their efforts keeps hackathons exciting.

## What engineering managers can do to maximize value

A hackathon is only as valuable as what happens **after it ends**. Too often, great ideas are built, demoed, and then forgotten. An engineering manager can ensure that does not happen by following up on promising projects.

One of the best ways to do this is by setting aside time in sprint planning to discuss which hackathon projects could move forward. Some ideas might turn into full-fledged features, while others could be quick wins that improve developer productivity. If an idea is promising but needs refinement, encouraging an engineer to **write an RFC or prototype a follow-up** can keep momentum going.

The value of a hackathon is not just in the projects, it is in how it changes the way engineers think. **Hackathons encourage experimentation, ownership, and creative problem-solving**. When engineers know their ideas are taken seriously, they feel more empowered to push for improvements outside of the hackathon as well.

## Hackathons at the team level create real impact

Unlike large company-wide hackathons, a focused, team-driven approach ensures that projects stay relevant, actionable, and aligned with team goals. The best hackathons spark innovation, fix real pain points, and give engineers the creative space they need to experiment.


**For engineering managers, organizing a hackathon is one of the most effective ways to foster innovation at a team level. When done right, a hackathon is not just a fun break from sprint work. It is a culture-building exercise that encourages engineers to think beyond their daily tasks and take ownership of improvements.**

**If your team has never done one, it might be time to ask: what could we build if we gave ourselves the time to experiment?**
