Technical debt is a concept in software development that refers to the shortcuts, outdated code, or inefficiencies that make future development harder. Just like financial debt, technical debt builds up over time and needs to be repaid. The longer it is ignored, the more costly it becomes. This debt can come from quick fixes made to meet deadlines, old systems that no longer fit the companyâ€™s needs, or even well-intentioned decisions that did not age well. 

While it is impossible to eliminate all technical debt, managing it properly ensures that a team can continue to develop new features without constantly struggling with past decisions.

The challenge is finding the right balance. A team that ignores technical debt will eventually slow down, spending more time fixing old issues than building new features. But a team that focuses only on fixing technical debt and stops delivering features will frustrate stakeholders and lose momentum. The key is to reduce technical debt while still moving forward.

## Why technical debt is a problem but also a reality

Technical debt comes in different forms. Sometimes, it is a shortcut taken to meet a deadline. Other times, it is an outdated architectural decision that no longer fits current needs. Even well-designed systems eventually become sources of tech debt as business requirements change.

I have seen this firsthand when working with a component-driven architecture integrated into a CMS. The goal was to allow the content team to build pages without relying on developers. Engineers built reusable components that could be assembled into pages within the CMS, reducing the need for development effort and speeding up content updates. But there was a gap. Forms were not built as CMS components. They were created as React components outside the CMS, meaning every form had to be manually hardcoded. 

The consequence was that any change required modifying multiple forms individually instead of updating a single reusable component.

At first, this was manageable. But as the number of forms requested by our business partners grew, so did the overhead. Changes that should have been simple could become time-consuming. It was clear this was technical debt, but completely migrating forms to the CMS would require significant effort. Meanwhile, the team still had to ship features.

This is the reality of tech debt. It is not always something that can be fixed immediately, but if left unaddressed, it slows down development and makes iteration harder. The challenge is how to prioritize and reduce technical debt while still delivering value.

## How to manage technical debt while still delivering features

The first step is making technical debt visible. One of the biggest mistakes teams make is treating tech debt as an unspoken burden rather than something that can be tracked and managed. If it is not documented, it will be ignored. Keeping a running list of tech debt, whether in backlog tickets or a dedicated document, helps teams make informed decisions about when and how to address it. I personally like to flag tech debt in the backlog by creating a dedicated 'tech debt' issue type. This helps in two key ways. First, it makes technical debt visible so it is not just something engineers complain about informally but a tracked problem that can be prioritized. Second, it separates tech debt from regular feature work, making it easier to discuss with stakeholders without mixing it into feature development. When technical debt is clearly labeled, it is much easier to advocate for time to fix it rather than letting it pile up unnoticed.

Another effective approach is integrating tech debt reduction into regular work instead of waiting for a big refactor. The "boy scout rule" is a good mindset, where engineers leave the code better than they found it. If an engineer is working on a feature that touches a messy part of the code base, it is better to clean up small issues as they go rather than leaving them for later.

Balancing roadmap planning is also crucial. Some teams dedicate a percentage of each sprint, such as ten to twenty percent, to technical debt work. This ensures that progress is being made without delaying business initiatives. Others take a more structured approach, allocating an entire sprint every few months to tackle larger tech debt tasks.

One of the most important but often overlooked strategies is avoiding unnecessary debt in the first place. Engineering managers and senior developers should push back when rushed decisions will lead to long-term pain. Sometimes, a small delay upfront prevents months of future rework.

## What engineering managers can do to keep the right balance

Engineering managers play a key role in making sure technical debt is managed without disrupting business priorities. One of the most effective ways to do this is by framing tech debt in terms of business impact rather than just technical concerns.

Stakeholders are more likely to support tech debt work when they understand its impact. Instead of saying, "we need to refactor the forms system," it is more effective to say, "right now, any form change requires manual updates across multiple places, which slows down releases and increases the risk of inconsistencies. If we refactor this, we will reduce maintenance time and speed up future feature development."

Prioritization is also key. Not all technical debt is equal. Some debt actively slows down development, while other debt is more of a theoretical concern. Engineering managers should work with the team to identify the most critical areas so that high-impact fixes get prioritized.

Encouraging a culture of ownership helps ensure that tech debt is not ignored. When engineers feel responsible for improving the code base rather than just working around problems, small improvements happen naturally. This prevents tech debt from reaching a point where it requires massive intervention.

Finally, it is important to set the right expectations with leadership. If executives expect only feature work and do not see the need for maintenance, technical debt will pile up. Engineering managers need to advocate for sustainable development, making sure that leadership understands that addressing tech debt is part of keeping the team productive, not an optional extra task.

## Technical debt is never done, it is a process

Technical debt is not something that can be eliminated overnight, and that is okay. The goal is not to erase all debt but to keep it under control so it does not block progress.

Teams that manage technical debt well do not just move slower to clean up code. They move faster because they prevent small inefficiencies from turning into major roadblocks. By tracking debt, making incremental improvements, balancing roadmap priorities, and advocating for sustainable development, engineering leaders can ensure that technical debt is handled without stopping feature work. The question is not whether technical debt exists in your code base, because it does. The real question is whether your team has a plan to deal with it.

**An engineering manager ensures technical debt is managed without disrupting feature work. By making it visible, advocating for its resolution, and balancing priorities, they keep development sustainable. Teams that ignore debt slow down, while those that address it stay productive and adaptable.**
