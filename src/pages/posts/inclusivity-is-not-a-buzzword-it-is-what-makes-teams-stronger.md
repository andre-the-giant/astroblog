A great development team isn't just about technical skills. It's about the people. When a team is truly inclusive, everyone has the same opportunity to contribute, grow, and feel valued. That means more than just hiring a diverse group of people. It means making sure they are treated fairly, supported, and respected, whether they are a junior developer, a senior engineer, or someone sitting in the C-suite.

I have always pushed for better gender balance in my teams. Not just by hiring more women but by ensuring they are paid equally to their male counterparts.

Too many times, I have heard the argument that there are fewer women in tech programs at universities. That might be true, but it is not an excuse to let that imbalance continue in the workplace. If anything, it is a reason to work harder to change it.

But inclusivity is not just about gender. It is about making sure everyone, regardless of their background, personality, or challenges, has an environment where they can thrive.

## Why inclusivity matters in a development team

A team that welcomes different perspectives builds better software. When people from different backgrounds work together, they challenge each other's assumptions. They think through problems differently. They catch things others might miss. A team where everyone thinks the same way is a team that overlooks blind spots.

Inclusivity also impacts retention. When employees feel excluded or undervalued, they leave. That means companies not only lose good talent but also end up with a less diverse and less innovative team over time.

It is also about fairness. No one should have to work harder just to be taken seriously because of their gender, culture, neurodivergence, or personality type. Shy developers should not be ignored in discussions. Engineers with vision impairments should not struggle with tools that were not designed with accessibility in mind. People from different cultures should not feel like outsiders just because their communication style is different from the majority.

I have seen how these issues affect teams. I once had a talented developer on my team who rarely spoke in large meetings. He wasn't disengaged, he just preferred processing ideas before responding. Without realizing it, other team members would dominate discussions, and his input was often left out. When I noticed this, I made a point to give him time to respond after discussions, either in follow-up conversations or async messages. The quality of his insights made it clear we had been missing out.

A team that values inclusivity creates a space where everyone can do their best work.

## What engineering managers can do to create an inclusive team

It starts with setting the right example. If a manager does not take inclusivity seriously, neither will the team. That means calling out behavior that undermines respect, making sure meetings are structured so everyone has a voice, and ensuring fair opportunities for promotions and salary increases.

One thing I have done in my teams is rotate the person who leads meetings. Early in my career, I noticed the same few people always dominated discussions, and others rarely spoke up. So I started switching things up. Every sprint, a different person would facilitate. At first, some quieter engineers felt uncomfortable, but over time, it helped build confidence and balance the dynamic. The result was a more engaged team where more people felt comfortable contributing.

Hiring alone does not make a workplace inclusive. It is about making sure that once people are in the team, they are supported and treated equally. That might mean actively checking for pay gaps, making sure promotions are based on merit rather than personality, and creating an environment where people feel safe speaking up.

It also means being aware of how leadership decisions impact inclusivity. I once had an executive push for an aggressive hiring plan that filled the team quickly but without much consideration for diversity. I pushed back. I explained that we weren't just hiring for speed but for long-term success, and a more balanced team would be stronger in the long run. It took effort, but eventually, leadership saw the value.

## A strong team is an inclusive team

The best development teams are not just technically skilled. They are built on respect, fairness, and a commitment to making sure every voice is heard. A team that values inclusivity does not just attract diverse talent. It keeps it.

People do their best work when they know they belong. When inclusivity is treated as an afterthought, teams lose great people, produce weaker ideas, and struggle with morale. But when it is built into the culture from the ground up, the results speak for themselves.

**Engineering managers have a responsibility to shape that culture, not just by setting the right tone but by taking real action to back it up. Because in the end, an inclusive team is not just better for the people in it. It is better for the work they create and the impact they make.**
