## The power and complexity of diverse teams

A diverse team brings better ideas, stronger creativity, and richer problem-solving. It's not just a nice-to-have, it's a competitive advantage. But it also makes everything harder. Collaboration doesn't just happen because everyone is smart and kind. It takes **intention**. And most of that intention starts with understanding how we communicate.

## Communication gaps are everywhere

As teams grow more diverse, across culture, language, personality, and experience, so do the ways people express themselves, receive feedback, and make decisions. Without awareness and support, those differences can create tension, confusion, or silence. That's where engineering managers come in. Not to fix it, but **to create space for it**. To help people understand each other better, and work together more clearly.

When I moved from France to Canada, I felt that gap immediately. In France, it's normal to speak directly. Giving raw, honest opinions is often how we show respect. We debate. We push. We argue! In Canada, that same directness can feel aggressive or even disrespectful. Feedback is more careful, wrapped in softer words. Same intent, totally different delivery. If you don't know that, it's easy to offend someone, or to feel offended.

But that's just one example. I've seen so many others.

Some people want you to get to the point. Others want the backstory first so they can understand your reasoning. Some think quickly and speak up fast. Others need to reflect quietly before they respond. Some expect decisions to be made live. Others need to step away and process before they commit.

Even things like technical jargon or cultural idioms can create misunderstandings. A joke or phrase that feels normal to one person might be completely lost or even confusing to someone else. And in meetings, the loudest voice often wins the floor, while quieter team members might leave without ever sharing their ideas.

**These mismatches aren't personal failures**. They're just the reality of working with humans. And they won't go away by themselves.

## How engineering managers can support better collaboration

So what can we do? I believe there are three simple but powerful practices that make a real difference.

The first is the **retrospective**. Not just a place to talk about tickets or timelines, but a space to talk about how we're working together. When retros are safe and open, they help teams surface communication issues before they turn into frustration. It's a time to ask: are we listening to each other? Are we all being heard? Are we being honest? If we're not talking about it, we're probably stuck in patterns that don't work for everyone.

The second is the **anonymous pulse check**. Not everyone feels comfortable speaking up in a group. A simple survey can tell you how people are feeling about collaboration, feedback, clarity, and trust. It's not about metrics. It's about catching friction early. If someone's feeling isolated, unheard, or frustrated, you want to know that before it turns into disengagement.

<h3>A few questions I like to include in a README</h3>

- How do you like to receive feedback?
- What should someone avoid when talking to you?
- What makes you feel respected or included?
- What builds or breaks your trust?
- When do you feel most focused or creative?
- How do you like to be recognized?
- What do you find funny or energizing?
</aside>

And the third is the **team README**. A team README is a short document written by each team member that helps others understand how to work with them. It's not a set of hard rules, it's a personal guide meant to reduce friction and encourage trust by making invisible preferences visible. When someone shares how they prefer to communicate, how they like to receive feedback, or what they need to feel safe in a discussion, it helps the rest of the team show up more thoughtfully. It removes a layer of guessing and gives everyone a baseline of understanding.

These questions aren’t exhaustive. They’re just a start. What matters is that each person has a chance to reflect and share something honest about how they show up at work.
The README helps each person put their preferences into words so others don't have to guess.

**Collaboration isn't about getting everyone to act the same. It's about making space for difference, and helping people navigate those differences with empathy, clarity, and respect.**

**Great teams don't happen just because everyone is talented. They happen because someone took the time to make sure people understand each other, not just as professionals, but as people. That starts with how we talk to each other. And how we listen.**
