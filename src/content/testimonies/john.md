<p>Andre was always a pleasure and inspiration to work with. He was a hands-on Engineering Manager who cared deeply about his people, what they produced, and how they produced it. </p>

<p>I was a Sr Director of Engineering in another area when we worked together at ecobee, but my additional responsibility for Engineering Operations and Andre's participation in some Director-level activities gave us a regular opportunity to work together directly.</p>

<p>Andre was a champion of continuous improvement. He worked tirelessly with his direct reports to create a positive team environment and to help them grow and advance, he ensured the technology he was responsible for moved forward in the right direction and became less indebted over time, and he was very active and engaged with measuring and improving the way his team delivered.</p>

<p>One thing that stood out to me and that I was very impressed with was that in the absence of an Engineering Director in his area, Andre represented his group multiple times in Director-level Quarterly Engineering Reviews and planning, and ensured his group supported and kept up with Engineering-wide technical initiatives related to things like observability, availability, and service health.</p>

<p>Andre is an excellent leader and manager, and I would definitely welcome the opportunity to work with him again. He will be an asset to and a positive change agent for any organization that is lucky enough to have him.</p>
