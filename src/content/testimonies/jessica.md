<p>I had the pleasure of working with Andre during my time at ecobee, where I supported his team as a business partner. What stood out most was Andre's rare balance of technical expertise and emotional intelligence. He demonstrated a deep awareness of his team’s individual working styles, how they preferred to receive feedback, and their unique strengths and development areas.</p>

<p>Andre didn’t treat technical leadership and people leadership as separate. He understood that to meet high standards of output, he needed to adapt his management style to support each team member effectively. As a result, he fostered a team culture where people felt comfortable speaking up and managing up - a reflection of the trust and psychological safety he built.</p>

<p>The results? A high-performing team. </p>

<p>I would recommend Andre without hesitation for any dynamic environment that values both agility and diversity.</p>
